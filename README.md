# Class--Reminder
Developed an automatic bot using Python and Apple Script on VS Code to open my classes' Zoom and attendance links before online class. Implemented Apple Script to send iMessages from my computer to my phone. Used Python's time class to calculate real time in order to send the classes' information in accurate time.
